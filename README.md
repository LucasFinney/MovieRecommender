# MovieRecommender
A machine-learning based recommender for a theoretical streaming service.

## Goal:
Here, I'll work with a dataset of theoretical userIDs, movie titles, and movie ratings, using that data to create a neighborhood based collaborative filtering recommender. The recommender will be made using a correlation matrix with singular value decomposition.
